* Xcode Project Setup
1) Create a GitHub project ArgusCoreVideoSiX for Swift with an initial README.md file.
2) Clone the base project to the development system.
3) Create a Cocoa Touch Framework, ArgusCoreVideo, as a sibling of the .git folder from step 2.
4) Remove errors and run the tests (CMD-U) to verify the project is basically sane. Should have no errors.
5) Remove all test code to prepare for start of TDD.
6) Commit baseline code and notes, generate PR and merge to master.
7) Start using TDD to implement the use cases using the initial high level design work as a living guide.
